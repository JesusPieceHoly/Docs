# ðŸŒ‰ Cross-Chain Bridge

### Introduction

The BOLÃ­VAR Bridge is a decentralised cross-chain bridge system operated by BlockNG that allows for verification by multiple verifiers.

It allows the introduction of assets from other chains into smartBCH via bridge.

### Security

The cross-chain bridge allows multiple validators and will operate in a 2/3 format during the initial phase of operation. The three validators are : BlockNG, Mistswap and one other completely neutral BCH institution.

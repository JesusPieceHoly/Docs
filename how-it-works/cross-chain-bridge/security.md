### Smart Contracts

The Bolivar Contract is a fork of [Callisto Network](https://callisto.network/)'s cross-chain bridge contract.

Callisto Network is an experienced[ provider of audits](https://callisto.network/smart-contract-audit/) **.** Through multiple internal audits, we have used Callisto Network's contract as the basis for Bridge Bolivar.

### Security Model

{% embed url="https://callisto.network/cross-chain-bridges-security-model/" %}

### Validators

The cross-chain bridge allows multiple validators and will operate in a 2/3 format during the initial phase of operation.&#x20;

The Current validators:

* BlockNG
* [Mistswap](https://mistswap.fi/)&#x20;
* **One Neutral BCH Institution** (For the sake of protecting the security, the name is temporarily hidden)

We welcome other institutions of BCH (holding BCH volume > 2000 BCH) to join the verifier to increase security.

# üßëü§ùüßë Self-Distributing Social Network System (SSNS)

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tips:** SSNS not in effect for CIVIL BEAM, in order to ensure the ultimate justice of the democratic system.
{% endhint %}

### Exclusivity

BLOCKNG's referral reward system is driven by Self-Distributing Social Network System (SSNS), which has completely rewritten the boring promotion system.

### Make LAW With Your Friends

* Any citizen within the BLOCKNG system can create his own social network by creating an invitation code.
* When a brand new citizen (with no economic activity in the system) uses an invitation code for an activity, an irrevocable contractual relationship will be established.
* Once the contract is in force, the invitee will generate an additional 1-10% of the profit, which can be withdrawn by the inviter at any time.
* Once the contract is in force, it is impossible to change the contractual relationship by using other invitation codes, or by using special contract interfaces for illegal operations.

### Refer Reward Percentage

* BEAM pools with no fees have 10% referral bonus
* BEAM pools with **fees** only have 1% referral bonus (please be considerate of your friends)

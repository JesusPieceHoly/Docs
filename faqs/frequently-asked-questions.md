#### The whitepaper is bullshit !

The white paper is the part of the BlockNG protocol that we are most proud of. We even want to make an NFT for it.
We spent a year tweaking the content in the white paper to ensure that it would appeal to pure-hearted, sincere and courageous community members and keep out the "smart" and selfish haters.

* Do I trust the government ? Do I trust crypto ? Which one do I prefer to trust ?&#x20;
* Do I believe in Bitcoin Cash ? Do I believe in BLOCKCHAIN ? Do I believe in human values ?

# Pull requests

#### Welcome to pull requests!

Pull requests help you collaborate on code with other people. As pull requests are created, they’ll appear here in a searchable and filterable list. To get started, you should [create a pull request](.gitbook/assets/compare).

**ProTip!** Exclude everything labeled `bug` with [-label:bug](broken-reference).
